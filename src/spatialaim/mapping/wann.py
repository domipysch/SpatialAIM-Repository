"""Weighted Adaptive Nearest Neighbor (WANN) spot->state mapping.

Ports the reliability-weighted adaptive kNN of Di Salvo et al. (TMLR 2025,
*An Embedding is Worth a Thousand Noisy Labels*) to the SpatialAIM K-sweep. Reference
scRNA cells play the role of the (potentially noisy) training set and ST spots
the test set; a cell's label is its SpatialAIM state at the current K.

Two pieces per K:

1. **Label reliability** eta_c for every reference cell (Eq. 1 / Algorithm 1):
   the inverse of the smallest neighbourhood size k' (searched over the odd grid
   k' in {K_MIN, K_MIN+2, ..., K_MAX}) at which a k'-NN vote of the *other*
   reference cells recovers the cell's own state. Deep-in-class cells resolve at a
   small k' (high reliability); boundary/ambiguous cells need a large k' (low
   reliability); if none in range works, eta_c = 1/k_max.
2. **WANN** per spot (Eq. 2-4): the spot inherits the neighbourhood size
   k_T = 1/eta_n of its single nearest reference cell n, then votes over its
   top-k_T reference neighbours weighted by each neighbour's reliability eta_i.

The neighbour *rankings* (ref<->ref and spot<->ref, cosine on the shared genes)
depend only on the embeddings, not on K -- so they are computed once in
``prepare`` and only the per-cell state labels change per K. This replaces the
fixed-N ``majority_vote`` mapper and takes no ``n_neighbors`` parameter.
