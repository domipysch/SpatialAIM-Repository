"""Combined per-K scores and the K they select.

Pure computation over the sweep table (``k_comparison.csv``): it reduces each
criterion's two measured curves to one score per K, ranks the K, and names the
best one overall and per criterion. Both consumers use it — the sweep writes the
scores back into ``k_comparison.csv`` and the winning K into ``k_selection.json``
(see :mod:`spatialaim.analysis.ksweep`), and the GUI's "Comparing K" card renders the
same numbers on demand.

Each of the three K-sweep criteria is measured by *two* curves over K:

* reconstruction — per-spot and per-gene cosine similarity (raw, hard),
* spatial organisation — neighbourhood-enrichment and local-purity z-score,
* transcriptional coherence — ST-expression and SC-shared-gene modularity.

To plot the criteria against each other, each pair is reduced to one number per
K: their **harmonic mean**, which only rewards a K when *both* of its curves are
high (with an arithmetic mean one large value can carry a small one).

The two spatial z-scores live on very different scales (tens vs. hundreds), so
each is first divided by its own maximum over the sweep — putting both on a
common 0..1 scale — before the mean is taken. Scaling by the maximum (rather
than min-max) keeps zero at zero, so the shuffle null stays where it is. The
other two criteria's curves are already commensurate (cosine similarity,
modularity) and are combined as they are.

Only **reconstruction** carries a label-shuffle null — a chance-level crosshair in
the scatter panels — measured by the sweep (the post-mapping analysis writes the
shuffled-label median next to each observed value and ``k_comparison.csv`` collects
it) and reduced the same way as the score so the two are comparable. Nothing here
computes a metric. The other two criteria draw no crosshair:

* spatial organisation — its curves are already z-scores against exactly that
  shuffle, so the null is 0 for every K; a line pinned at zero says nothing, so it
  is not drawn,
* transcriptional coherence — a shuffled modularity is meaningless, so the sweep
  measures none.

Their null columns are therefore absent and ``combined_null`` yields NaN. The
coherence scatter axis is instead pinned to start at 0 (``axis_from_zero``) so the
modularities are read in absolute terms.
