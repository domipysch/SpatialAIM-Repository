"""Cross-K comparison: gather each K's key analysis metrics from its per-K
``analysis/data`` outputs into one table at the run root (``k_comparison.csv``),
score them, and record which K each criterion selects (``k_selection.json``).

``k_comparison.csv`` holds the measured metrics *and* what they reduce to: one
combined score per criterion, the overall score across criteria, and a ``pareto``
flag. Reads the files each K's post-mapping analysis already writes
(``cossim_summary.csv``, ``topology_metrics.json``, ``modularity_metrics.json``),
so it runs after the K-loop with no recomputation — including the label-shuffle
nulls those steps measured, which the GUI needs alongside the observed values.
Metrics missing for a given K come through as NaN. The scoring itself lives in
:mod:`spatialaim.metrics.kselection`, so a CLI run and the GUI's "Comparing K" card
report the same numbers.
