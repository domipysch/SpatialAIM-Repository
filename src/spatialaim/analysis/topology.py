    enrichment -- since ``mean_self_zscore`` is the sole value consumed downstream.
    For each state ``s`` we count the spatial-graph edges whose two endpoints are
    both in ``s`` and z-score that against a label-shuffling null (the same null
    ``sq.gr.nhood_enrichment`` uses), then average the per-state z-scores. This
    skips squidpy's full K x K enrichment matrix and its per-K call overhead, so it
    is markedly cheaper than a full ``nhood_enrichment`` run. A high value means
    states preferentially border their own kind.
